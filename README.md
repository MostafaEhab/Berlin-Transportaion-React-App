# Berlin-Transportaion-React-App

## Goal 

Develop web app based on React.js for the public transport in Berlin. 

## Website Features 
1) Create a web app that uses the public transport API of Berlin [API link](https://v5.vbb.transport.rest/api.html) to search
through stops.

2) When showing results, show which transport options are available in the
resulting stop(s). Example transport options are: bus, tram, ferry, suburban, express,
regional.

3) If the user selects a stop, route the user to the detail page of that stop where the user can
see the departures from the stop.

4) Users are able to mark some stops favorite so that they can quickly access them
instead of searching every time. 

5) Implementing an offline version of the app incase the internet connection was interrupted which has the following features, Userâ€™s favorite stops and the related information and all results of previously performed searches so that the
user can perform searches on a partial set of the data.
